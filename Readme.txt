The program can be launch directly on linux by double clicking on road-network-generator.

To compile the program from the source code you need to use qmake:

	-Move to the Source_code folder: 
	-Execute: qmake road-network-generator.pro
	-Execute: make
	-Run the program: ./road-network-generator

If you get a windows with a blue background it is probably because the heightmap (hmap.png) and the density map (dmap.png) are note in the same folder as the executable file.
